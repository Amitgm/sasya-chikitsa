# 💬 WhatsApp-Style Chat Experience - FIXED

## ❌ **Previous Problem**
Every streaming message was creating its **own separate card**, creating a fragmented experience:

```
❌ BEFORE (Multiple cards - fragmented):
User: My plant has yellow spots

Assistant Card 1: 🔍 Analyzing your plant image...

Assistant Card 2: 🧬 Disease Classification Complete

Assistant Card 3: 💊 Recommended Treatments:

Assistant Card 4: 📝 What would you like to know next?
                  [Follow-up buttons]
```

This broke the natural conversation flow and looked unprofessional.

## ✅ **WhatsApp-Style Solution**
Now all streaming responses for **one user request** are accumulated into **ONE cohesive message card**:

```
✅ AFTER (Single card - cohesive):
User: My plant has yellow spots
