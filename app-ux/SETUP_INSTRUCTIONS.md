# App-UX Module Setup Instructions

## ✅ Duplicate Resources Issue - RESOLVED

The duplicate resources error has been fixed by:

### 🛠️ Changes Made:
1. **Removed conflicting launcher icons**: Deleted placeholder `.webp` files that were causing conflicts
2. **Updated AndroidManifest.xml**: Now uses custom drawable icon instead of mipmap
3. **Fixed theme naming**: Changed theme name to avoid conflicts (`Theme.SasyaChikitsyaUX`)
4. **Updated app name**: Changed to `"Sasya Chikitsya UX"` to avoid conflicts with main app
5. **Removed duplicate styles**: Eliminated duplicate `styles.xml` file
