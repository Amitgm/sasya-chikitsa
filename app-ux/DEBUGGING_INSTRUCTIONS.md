# App-UX Debugging Instructions

## Issue: Only Green Leaf Logo Visible

You're seeing only the green leaf logo instead of the full interface. This suggests a layout loading issue or silent crash.

### üîç I've Added Debugging Code

The MainActivity now includes extensive logging and error handling to help identify the problem:

```kotlin
// onCreate now has try-catch with detailed logging
// initializeViews has step-by-step logging
// All errors will show Toast messages
```

### üì± Steps to Debug:

#### Step 1: Rebuild and Install
1. **Rebuild** the app in Android Studio (Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project)
2. **Install** the updated version on your emulator/device
3. **Launch** the app again

#### Step 2: Check for Error Messages
When you launch the app, look for:
- **Toast messages** at the bottom of screen with error details
- **Success message**: "App loaded successfully!" if it works

#### Step 3: Check Android Logs (If Available)
If you have Android Studio's Logcat open:
1. **Filter** by "SasyaUX" tag
2. **Look for** debug messages showing loading progress
3. **Check for** any error messages in red

### üéØ Expected Debug Output

**If successful, you should see:**
- Toast: "App loaded successfully!"
- Logcat: "MainActivity onCreate completed successfully"
- Logcat: "All views initialized successfully!"

**If there's an error, you should see:**
- Toast with specific error message
- Logcat error details

### üõ†Ô∏è Possible Issues & Solutions:

#### **Issue 1: Resource Not Found**
- **Symptoms**: Error about missing layouts or styles
- **Solution**: The styles.xml or layout might have issues

#### **Issue 2: View Binding Errors**  
- **Symptoms**: findViewById crashes or returns null
- **Solution**: Layout XML might have incorrect IDs

#### **Issue 3: Theme/Style Issues**
- **Symptoms**: App crashes on setContentView
- **Solution**: Theme inheritance or attribute problems

### üö® Quick Fix - Simplified Layout Test

If the main layout still fails, I can create a minimal test layout to isolate the issue:

1. **Simple text-only layout** to test basic functionality
2. **Gradually add components** back to identify the problem
3. **Fix the specific issue** once identified

### üìã Next Steps:

1. **Try the rebuilt app** with debugging code
2. **Report back** what error messages you see (if any)  
3. **Share screenshots** of any error toasts
4. **If still only green logo**: We'll create a minimal test layout to isolate the problem

The debugging code will help us identify exactly where the loading process is failing! üîç
